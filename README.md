## Structure
The project follows Uncle Bob's clean architecture principles and consists of three layers:

1. Models Layer (not mentioned in the diagram)
2. Repository Layer
3. Usecase Layer

All layers are designed to be interchangeable. For example, you can easily replace the `mysqlRepository` with `MongoRepository`, which implements the Partner Repository. Additionally, in tests, you can use a mock usecase for better testability.

Note: The Delivery layer has not been abstracted for the sake of simplicity.
